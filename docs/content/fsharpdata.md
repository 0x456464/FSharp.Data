# F# Data: Library for Data Access

The F# Data library (`FSharp.Data.dll`) implements everything you need to access data 
in your F# applications and scripts. It implements F# type providers for working with 
structured file formats and for accessing the WorldBank and Freebase data. It 
also includes helpers for parsing JSON and CSV files and for sending HTTP requests.

This library focuses on providing type providers for data access.
It does not aim to be a comprehensive collection of F# type 
providers (which can be used for numerous other purposes). Moreover, this library 
(currently) does not provide API for _creating_ documents.
